This library provides a high-level Clojure interface to the HDF5
library for storing scientific data. It is built on top of the JHDF5
library, which provides a high-level Java interface. While JHDF5 can
be used directly from Clojure, this additional layer adds a lot of
convenience:

- Uses Clojure vectors rather than Java arrays for array I/O.
- Multimethods reduce the huge Java API to just a few functions.

This library is work in progress. Only scalar and 1D array data
are supported at the moment, both for datasets and attributes.
